# Binary counter on Nios&reg; II soft core

---

This is simple example of the Nios&reg; soft processor provided by Altera (Intel).
FPGA design was generated using Platform Designer from Quartus. It's just a simple
example using Nios core, on-chip memory for the program, and jtag-uart to send debug
data to the console. Software for Nios was generated using Nios II Software Build Tools for Eclipse.
I've used Hello-world small template to generate the code. Altera provides binary counter template,
which is far more sophisticated (support for external interrupt trigger, support for 7-seg display,
as well LCD). This is the simpliest example showing usage of BSP macros and libraries.
